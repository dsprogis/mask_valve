# mask valve
Valve developed to exhaust moist air from a face mask to prevent glasses from fogging.

## Problem:
You want to try to use a coffee filter as a mask but the humidity in the air you exhale blows back against your cheeks and fogs your eyeglasses.  Furthermore, the humidity builds up quickly in the material of the mask which can accelerate its deterioration and efficacy.
