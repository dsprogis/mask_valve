# Mask Valve
A 3D printed valve developed to exhaust moist air from a face mask to prevent glasses from fogging.

## Problem:
You want to try to use a coffee filter as a mask but the humidity in the air you exhale blows back against your cheeks and fogs your eyeglasses.  Furthermore, the humidity builds up quickly in the material of the mask which can accelerate its deterioration and efficacy.

## Solution:
![cpmmercially available next to printed](/images/assembled2.jpg)
The commercially available solution (left) has a valve that blocks air on inhalation so that air is forced through the filter.  However, it allows air on exhalation to exit easily.  This prevents blowback of moist air against the cheeks (which fogs glasses) and it reduces the build up of moisture in the mask.

This project contains print files for the two 3D printed parts shown on the right.  They can be assembled and affixed to a coffee filter, along with a small circular piece of 3mil plastic bag, as shown on the right.
